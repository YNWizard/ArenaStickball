## ArenaStickball (we dont know what we're doing: the game)
# NOTES
-anything you made from the sound effect on has been removed so u need to push and commit them again bc i finally managed to fix the thing at that cost. everything should be working ok

-disabled 7 ball spawning and made 1 ball spawn on repeat just for me so i could test animation and tweak it
# TO DO
-make fps 60

-add more polish texture/gameplay-wise
