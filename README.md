# ArenaStickball (we dont know what we're doing: the game)
## TO DO
-make balls easier to hit when they're going fast

-add more polish texture/gameplay-wise

## Bugs:
-some balls dont spawn sometimes

-players clip through walls

-balls clip through walls when they go fast enough

-ball direction has a mind of its own when hit

-goals are really unresponsive and unreliable
